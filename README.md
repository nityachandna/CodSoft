# TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

# AIM
The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on given features.

# DATASET 
The dataset for this project is imported from a CSV file (titanic_survival.csv). It contains information about individual passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin including their 
survival status.

# FILES 
The following files have been created/used for this project:
1. titanic_survival.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and the detailed explanation of the project. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization.
2. titanic_survival.csv: This is the dataset, in the form of a CSV file, used for the project.
